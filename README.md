# use_github_colab

This is the simply process I can use to push models/scripts from google colab to github directly  
includes:

(1) create a new repo on google drive or clone a repo from github to your google drive 

(2) common git command to run from inside colab 

(3) use `notebook2script.py` script to convert cells into a python module (.py)
